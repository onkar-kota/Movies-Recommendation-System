#Machine Learning Project â€“ Data Science Movie Recommendation System Project in python

This system is capable of learning my watching patterns and providing me with relevant suggestions. Having witnessed the fourth industrial revolution where Artificial Intelligence and other technologies are dominating the market, I am sure that you must have come across a recommendation system in your everyday life. I am also sure that by this time curiosity must be getting the best of you. 

The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users. This R project is designed to help you understand the functioning of how a recommendation system works. We will be developing an Item Based Collaborative Filter.

What is a Recommendation System?
A recommendation system provides suggestions to the users through a filtering process that is based on user preferences and browsing history. The information about the user is taken as an input. The information is taken from the input that is in the form of browsing data. This information reflects the prior usage of the product as well as the assigned ratings. A recommendation system is a platform that provides its users with various contents based on their preferences and likings. A recommendation system takes the information about the user as an input. The recommendation system is an implementation of the machine learning algorithms.
